# Overview

This small program is the beginning setup of an iterated rock-paper-scissors style game involving three classes. 

The primary purpose of this program in particular is to see how the rust language works and how it's able to handle temporary data storage 
and tracking information.

# Future Work

- finish the actual gameplay loop  
- more classes, potentially ranged or magic to fit the setting 
- a way to hide the previous player's choice from the second one to prevent competitive advantage while hot-seating
